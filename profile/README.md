## Presentation

Here you can find a complete report [here](report).

And some short video in which the robot solves the given tasks

### Simulation
* [Task 1](link)
* [Task 2](link)
* [Task 3](link)
* [Task 4](link)

### Real robot
* [Task 1](link)
* [Task 2](link)
Task 3 and 4 are missing because it would not feasible to solve them using a 3-finger gripper. Check the result in simulation environment instead.
