# PiJoint organization

Final project for *Introduction to Robotics* course at the University of Trento.

## Authors

This project has been developed by Maglie Francesco, Mizzaro Alessandro and Zaupa Alberto. Main contribution:

* [Kinematics](https://github.com/PiJoint/kinematics) - Maglie Francesco and Zaupa Alberto

* [Vision](https://github.com/PiJoint/vision) - Mizzaro Alessandro


## Presentation

You can find a complete report [here](report).

These are some short videos in which the robot solves the given tasks:

### Simulation
* [Task 1](link)
* [Task 2](link)
* [Task 3](link)
* [Task 4](link)

### Real robot
* [Task 1](link)
* [Task 2](link)

Task 3 and 4 are missing because it would not feasible to solve them using a 3-finger gripper. Check the result in simulation environment instead.

[Here](link) you can find the KPI for each task.
